“Two Villages” is a Java based social decision game. It was designed to investigate cross-cultural collaboration and cultural golden values and supports two players over the internet and extensive user input tracking. Two players in different rooms would each control the wildfire fighting capabilities of one of the two neighboring villages. The game was designed to explore trust and reciprocation between the two players as wildfires threatened the two villages with varying degrees of severity. Below is the introductory video played to familiarize participants with the game.

On the backend of the game, we used
* [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/) map editor for creating isometric world maps
* [Slick2D](http://slick.ninjacave.com/) for graphics rendering
* [Java Game Networking (JGN)](http://code.google.com/p/jgn/) for multiplayer connectivity

The codebase was written in Java and runs on Windows, Linux and OSX. Two Villages was developed at Carnegie Mellon University.
