(SUAVE) Simple UAV Environment investigated strategies using World-In-Miniature models to maintain situational awareness and control teams of up to 22 UAVs, comparing WIM to traditional strategies which display each individual image feed.

Here a 3D terrain mesh has been painted using a low resolution and outdated satellite image. A SUAVE team of simulated UAVs flies through the environment,  collecting camera imagery. The live camera imagery is used to update the image "painted" onto the terrain mesh in real-time. UAV flight paths are rendered as white lines and the UAV's current location is represented by a sphere. The user can then fly through the model to view terrain from specific locations and angles looking for areas of interest.
