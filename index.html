Hello!
I am a roboticist especially interested in problems involving planning, robot teams, and human-robot interaction.
I completed my Ph.D. in Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University advised by Dr. Paul Scerri.
My thesis presented a markup language used to annotate human-robot team plans with domain context, which is interpreted at run-time to modify UI, autonomy, and decision making strategies.
The language was evaluated through extensive field testing with a large team of ASVs as well as a learnability evaluation.
This project and simulator, as well as others, are available at my GitHub page <a href="https://github.com/nbbrooks">here</a>.

My thesis and information on other publications are available
<a href="/publications/">here</a>.
Summaries and videos of other project I have worked on at CMU's Robotics Institute can be viewed <a href="/projects/">here</a>.
Beyond CMU, I have also enjoyed working on robotics projects at Perceptronics Solutions Inc, General Electric, and NASA Marshall Space Flight Center.
